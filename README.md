Download all the files in this repository.
To work with the huskylens code you should install some prerequisites. Most of them require creating a virtual environment so it is better to do that.

Create a virtual environment in Python.
Install prerequisites(these are what I remember but thre could be more):
  - pyserial
  - pypng
  - json
  - pygame

Check online on how to install them or how to create the virtual environment.
You can also copy/paste this README file to an LLM like ChatGPT and just follow the instructions.
